Build a Python program that extracts text from a PNG image file.
The image has white text on top of a stock market chart.  The white text is what you need to extract.
Please print each extracted line out to the terminal.

An example image you can test with is in this project with the file name '2026-02-10_08-53-49.png'
The first four lines of text should be as follows:

  Resistance Zone 26268.00-26360.50 (Short-term Bias Confirming Zone)
  24H Range Extreme High
  Resistance Zone 26174.00-26237.00 (Intraday Bias Confirming Zone)
  24H Range Exhaustion High

Create a test that verifies this.
